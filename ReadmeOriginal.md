The All-in-one Combat Timing bar with the update all of you guys have been waiting for!

Since Darianopolis can no longer maintain the Addon, I will probably do further updates only on the "optional Update", as it is easier for me to maintain. - barny

Should there be any bugs, feel free to report them on my [url="https://www.esoui.com/portal.php?id=386&a=listbugs"]ESOUI Portal[/url].

Beta versions are available on [url="https://github.com/barny22/CombatMetronome/tree/Development"]Github[/url]. Install at your own risk.

[quote]IMPORTANT: [color="Red"]I no longer play ESO and can't actively maintain this addon.[/color]
I have enabled "Allow Updates & AddOns" if someone wants to keep this release working with new ESO API and library changes.
Anyone is absolutely [u][color="Green"]free[/color][/u] to use this addon and adapt, modify or build it into any project you're working on.
I would love to see some version of this addon continue, but I don't have the time or available classes to re-install ESO and properly maintain and bug-fix for all of the different classes and abilities on new builds and changes.[/quote]

Track your heavy swings, ability cooldowns and cast/channels all in one bar to help you perfect your rotation timing and take advantage of abilty queuing with live latency information.
Now includes optional Ultimate tracking.

This addon's counterpart "Combat Auras" has now been released! (You can see it in the preview)
https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2408-CombatAurasAbilityTimers.html

IMPORTANT - This addon and "Combat Auras" SHOULD always be updated at the same time. They share a common library to improve perforamnce, and there is a good chance on any update that I've made changes to this central library.

[quote]IMPORTANT: There have been changes to the central library. Combat Auras probably won't work after you updated Combat Metronome![/quote]
