An updated Version of Darianopolis' tool "Combat Metronome". (That's why he is mentioned as author.)
I added some fixes and new options:

!  Fixed time adjustment on exhausting fatecarver depending on crux
!  Fixed: Channeled abilities or abilities with cast time are now interrupted by block, dodgeroll or barswap
!  Fixed a bug after resizing the cast bar in unlock mode
+  Added options to display remaining time, spell name and spell icon on cast bar for spells with cast/channel time
+  Remaining time label and spell icon now move according to bar alignment
+  Added option to stop HA tracking
+  Added option to show the cast bar permanently
+  Added fancy mode
